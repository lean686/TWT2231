                Air pollution is now the world's largest environmental health risks. Air Pollution 
                is a mixture of solid particles and gasses into the air. It occurs when the earth 
                contains harmful amounts of gasses such as C02 and methane, dust, fumes and odour.
                <br>
                <br>
                Inhaling polluted air takes away 2 to 3 years of typical humanl life. It has effect
                such as burning eyes, itchy throat, breathing problems and even death. The world is 
                getting hotter and more crowded, engines continue to pump out dirty emissions, and half 
                the world has no access to clean fuels or technologies (e.g. stoves, lamps), the very 
                air we breathe is growing dangerously polluted: nine out of ten people now breathe 
                polluted air, which kills 7 million people every year.

                What you can do about Air Pollution?

                        <strong>Drive your car less.</strong> 
                        Vehicle exhaust is a major source of air pollution. Driving your car less helps reduce air pollution because vehicles emit pollutants like CO2, NOx, 
                        particulate matter, and VOCs, which contribute to smog, acid rain, and respiratory issues. Fewer car trips mean lower emissions, improving air quality 
                        and public health, and mitigating climate change. Using alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, public transit, and carpooling also 
                        supports more sustainable urban development and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Don't burn your garbage.</strong> 
                        Burning your household garbage is dangerous to your health and our environment, and generally against the law in Minnesota. If you're still using a burn barrel, 
                        wood stove, or fire-pit for your trash, contact your county about arranging for trash hauling services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Plant and care for trees.</strong> 
                        Trees filter pollutants and absorb carbon dioxide. Trees also release oxygen into the atmosphere and help cool our homes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Keep your car in good repair. </strong> 
                        Fix exhaust and oxygen sensor problems ASAP. Check your tire pressure monthly; under-inflated tires have been shown to lower 
                        gas mileage, particularly at lower speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Support Clean Air legislation</strong> 
                        Keep an eye on local developments and policy changes that are focused on air pollution. One such policy that areas 
                        in is Section 51 of the Environmental Quality Act 1974 (No. 127) which entrusts to the Minister the power to make 
                        regulations, after consultation with the Council, for prescribing ambient air quality standards and emission standards.
